# JAVA healthcheck-application 
A spring boot rest application built with Gradle.
The project source code and build files are committed to the public gitHub repository: https://github.com/shaima-mahmoud/healthcheck-application

Build folder wasn't supposed to be commited to the GitHub beside the source code.
It should've been built using a CI tool somewhere on a server then to be downloaded to the docker container.

And when running the project, the repository should be cloned and then we should navigate to the project folder to start bulding the images.

The project container starts from docker-compose.yml file that builds 2 images subsequently,
the Data base image from the given git repository and the healthcheck-application.

All steps are listed in the build instructions.

The code is covered by unit test for the controller methods only, no service classes or DAO classes unit test.
I could cover the OK, NOT_FOUND status, but not the SERVER_ERROR status.
